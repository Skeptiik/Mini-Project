# Mini-Project  
AdlUni-FirstProject  
This is a test website

The functions include:

  3 links in the header redirecting to other websites  
  small animations when the user hovers over the header links  
  A contact form, which requires a user name and email  
  
Issues I had:
  the website formatting breaks a bit when viewing on a 1920x1080 display.  
  I did all the coding on a 2560x1440 display and it looks fine
